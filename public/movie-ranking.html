<h2>My top movies</h2>
<h3>Anime movies</h3>
<h4>Weathering with you</h4>
<p>I remember watching this during Covid-19 lockdown</p>
<h3>Old films</h3>
<h4>The Godfather Trilogy</h4>
<p>Some say it's overrated but for me it's one of the best mafia movies ever created<br />
    Another similar movie is "The Goodfellas"
</p>
<h3>Comics</h3>
<h4>Spiderman: through the spiderverse</h4>
<p>This 2.5 Hours long movie felt very short.<br />
    I am not a huge fan of comics inspired movies like DC or Marvel but this one caught my attention.
